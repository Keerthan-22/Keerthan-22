# Advanced Intelligent Security Framework (AISF) Implementation

Complete implementation package for validating and reproducing the Advanced Intelligent Security Framework (AISF) empirical results. This implementation includes all four core components with mathematical foundations as described in the research paper.

## Overview

The AISF framework provides a comprehensive cybersecurity solution through four integrated components:

1. **Real-Time Context-Based Access Control** - Dynamic risk assessment using Threat Probability Score (TPS)
2. **Predictive Threat Anticipation** - Machine learning-based threat prediction and zero-day detection
3. **Continuous Threat Hunting** - Proactive threat detection using multiple hunting techniques
4. **Automated Incident Response** - PPO-based intelligent response action selection

## Features

- ✅ **Threat Probability Score (TPS) Calculation** - Multi-factor risk assessment
- ✅ **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Behavioral Anomaly Detection** - User behavior analysis
- ✅ **Random Forest Threat Classification** - Achieving 97.69% accuracy target
- ✅ **Zero-Day Attack Detection** - Autoencoder-like approach using PCA + outlier detection
- ✅ **Threat Intelligence Confidence Scoring** - Weighted indicator assessment
- ✅ **Continuous Threat Hunting Engine** - IoC matching, behavioral analysis, APT detection
- ✅ **PPO-based Incident Response** - Reinforcement learning for optimal response selection
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing Suite** - Unit tests, integration tests, and performance validation

    ThreatProbabilityScore, 
    BehavioralAnomalyDetector,
    PredictiveThreatEngine,
    ThreatHuntingEngine,
    PPOIncidentResponse

print(f"TPS Score: {tps_score}")

# Component 2: Behavioral Anomaly Detection
anomaly_detector = BehavioralAnomalyDetector()
# Train on normal behavior data
behavior_data = generate_user_behavior_data()
anomaly_detector.fit(behavior_data.values)
# Detect anomalies
test_behavior = behavior_data.sample(10).values
anomaly_scores = anomaly_detector.predict_anomaly(test_behavior)

# Component 3: Threat Hunting
hunting_engine = ThreatHuntingEngine()
log_data = [{'timestamp': datetime.now(), 'source_ip': '192.168.1.100'}]
network_data = [{'flow_id': 1, 'bytes': 5000}]
hunting_results = hunting_engine.hunt_threats(log_data, network_data)

# Component 4: Incident Response
ppo_response = PPOIncidentResponse()
incident = {
    'severity': 0.8,
    'confidence': 0.9,
    'asset_criticality': 0.7,

## Mathematical Implementation

### 1. Threat Probability Score (TPS)

```
TPS(u,t) = Σ(i=1 to n) w_i · R_i(u,t) · α_i(t)
```

Where:
- `w_i` = weight for risk factor i
- `R_i(u,t)` = risk score for factor i at time t
- `α_i(t)` = temporal decay factor

### 2. Gaussian Mixture Model for Behavioral Anomaly Detection

```
P(x|θ) = Σ(k=1 to K) π_k * N(x|μ_k, Σ_k)
```

Where:
- `π_k` = mixture weights
- `N(x|μ_k, Σ_k)` = Gaussian distribution with mean μ_k and covariance Σ_k

### 3. Threat Intelligence Confidence

```
C_indicator = Σ(i=1 to m) w_i · c_i · f_i / Σ(i=1 to m) w_i
```

Where:
- `w_i` = source reliability weight
- `c_i` = indicator confidence
- `f_i` = freshness factor

### 4. PPO Loss Function

```
L^PPO(θ) = E_t[min(r_t(θ)Â_t, clip(r_t(θ), 1-ε, 1+ε)Â_t)]
```

Where:
- `r_t(θ)` = probability ratio
- `Â_t` = advantage estimate
- `ε` = clipping parameter
